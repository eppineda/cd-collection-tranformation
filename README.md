# cd-collection-tranformation
sample conversions of XML database to HTML output

## Instructions

For the skills test there are three files.

* list.xml – this is a simple data list of someone’s CD collection
* form.xsl – this is the file that transforms the list.xml document into an HTML file
* tableOutput.png – this a screenshot of what that HTML file should look like in a browser

The xsl file contains errors that keep it from creating the correct HTML code.

In paragraph form, describe the errors you find in the xsl code.

Attach a corrected xsl file

In paragraph form describe how you would edit the xsl code to improve the HTML output beyond what is shown in the tableOutput.png file.
